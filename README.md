# Daily Calendar 

This is the source code for a simple drag-and-drop calendar. It was designed for Georgia Tech's Tikkun Olam Makers 2024 Makeathon, where teams are partnered with a need-knower (a stakeholder with personal, first-hand experience of an unmet need).

Our need-knower was the mother of a young girl with autism, and she requested a customizable visual schedule to help her daughter better manage fluctuations in her daily schedule. 

## Usage
Access the website: https://daily-calendar.pages.dev
- Drag and drop events from the sidebar onto the calendar. 
- To delete events on the calendar, tap or click on the event. 
- Create new events with custom icons using the image address of the desired icon.
